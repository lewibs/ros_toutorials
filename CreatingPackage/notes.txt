catkin Package:
1. The package must contain a catkin compliant package.xml file. That package.xml file provides meta information about the package.
2. The package must contain a CMakeLists.txt which uses catkin. If it is a catkin metapackage it must have the relevant boilerplate CMakeLists.txt file.
3. Each package must have its own folder. This means no nested packages or sharing the same dir.

example:
package/
  CMakeLists.txt
  package.xml

The reccomended method of working with theis is witha  catkin workspace

workspace_folder/        -- WORKSPACE
  src/                   -- SOURCE SPACE
    CMakeLists.txt       -- 'Toplevel' CMake file, provided by catkin
    package_1/
      CMakeLists.txt     -- CMakeLists.txt file for package_1
      package.xml        -- Package manifest for package_1
    ...
    package_n/
      CMakeLists.txt     -- CMakeLists.txt file for package_n
      package.xml        -- Package manifest for package_n

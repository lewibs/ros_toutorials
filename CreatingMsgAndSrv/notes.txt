msg: txt files that are used to describe the fields of a ROS message. They are used for messages in different languages
srv: a srv file describes a service. It is composed of two parts, a request, and a response.

msgs are just simple text files with a field type and field name per line. The field types you can use are:

int8, int16, int32, int64 (plus uint*)
float32, float64
string
time, duration
other msg files
variable-length array[] and fixed-length array[C]

There is also a special type in ROS: Header, the header contains a timestamp and coordinate frame information that are commonly used in ROS. You will frequently see the first line in a msg file have Header header.

Here is an example of a msg that uses a Header, a string primitive, and two other msgs :
  Header header
  string child_frame_id
  geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovariance pose
  geometry_msgs/TwistWithCovariance twist


srv files are just like msg files, except they contain two parts: a request and a response. The two parts are separated by a '---' line. Here is an example of a srv file:

int64 A
int64 B
---
int64 Sum


rosmsg is then used to display the message
rosmsg show beginner_tutorials/Num

rossvr is used to display svr details

rospack = ros+pack(age) : provides information related to ROS packages
roscd = ros+cd : changes directory to a ROS package or stack

rosls = ros+ls : lists files in a ROS package

roscp = ros+cp : copies files from/to a ROS package

rosmsg = ros+msg : provides information related to ROS message definitions
rossrv = ros+srv : provides information related to ROS service definitions
catkin_make : makes (compiles) a ROS package
rosmake = ros+make : makes (compiles) a ROS package (if you're not using a catkin workspace)
catkin build: makes (compiles) a ROS package in an isolated manner while maintaining efficiency due to parallelisation
catkin_make + catkin_make_isolated
